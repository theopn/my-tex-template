# My Tex Template

This is the LaTeX homework template that I use for my schoolwork. My primary use for 

1. CS, algorithms
2. Linear algebra, math
3. Propositional Logic Proofs: As a CS and philosophy double major, I have taken and will take number of discrete math/logic classes.

# Clean Linear Algebra HW Template
A simple and cLeAn hw template for linear algebra homework

This homework template is inspired by 
https://github.com/jdavis/latex-homework-template
but I am planning on making more changes and add features to diffrentiate it from it.
The template is also supposed to be portable (work on with minimum package requirement) and more linear algebra focused.

Feel free to take a look at the .pdf file, and clone the repository to use it or make changes.

Good luck with your homework!
